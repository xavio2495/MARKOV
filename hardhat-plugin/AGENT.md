# Git-like Versioning for ERC-2535 Diamond Contracts

You are an expert TypeScript developer and Ethereum smart contract engineer specializing in Hardhat plugins and the ERC-2535 Diamond standard. Your task is to develop a complete Hardhat plugin called "markov" based on the following specifications. Use the Hardhat 3 plugin template as the starting point. Ensure the plugin is efficient, using a dynamic array combined with a hash map for version history management, now extended to support multi-branch with a simple DAG structure. Output the full code structure, including all necessary files, configurations, and implementations. Provide explanations where needed, but focus on delivering functional, testable code.

Use viem for all contract interactions, as Hardhat supports it via the `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-viem` plugin. Integrate this by adding it as a dependency and using `hre.viem` for clients and deployments (e.g., `hre.viem.deployContract`, `hre.viem.getWalletClient`, `hre.viem.getPublicClient`, `hre.viem.simulateContract`, `hre.viem.writeContract`).

## Project Overview
- **Aim**:
  1. Develop a Hardhat plugin that functions as a Git-like versioning system for smart contracts, with support for branching and merging.
  2. Use ERC-2535 Diamond standard contracts to represent the "repository," where facets are modular code versions that can be added, replaced, or removed via `diamondCut`.
  3. Automate tasks similar to Git and GitHub, with version history stored in a hybrid manner: off-chain in a local JSON file for quick access, verifiable and synced via on-chain `DiamondCut` events.
  4. Integrate AI for gas optimization and smart contract analysis to enhance safety and efficiency.
  5. Support multi-chain deployments and operations for broader compatibility.
  6. Include an autonomous AI agent that leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect to external blockchain data sources for real-time on-chain activity tracking and reporting of the Diamond contract (e.g., monitoring events, transactions, and generating summaries/reports). Use Blockscout MCP server for blockchain data access, Fetch.ai uAgents for agent orchestration, and Agentverse for MCP integration where applicable.

- **Features (CLI Commands)**:
  1. `markov config`: Sets EVM chain, user wallet address, gas fees, and author details (updates `hardhat.config.ts` or a dedicated config file).
  2. `markov init`: Creates a new Diamond contract ERC-2535 structure in the repo and initialises markov versioning through .markov
  3. `markov clone`: Clones a Diamond contract from a source chain using a provided contract ID/address.
  4. `markov log`: Displays logs of contract updates, deployments, and status (from local history and on-chain events).
  5. `markov deploy`: Deploys new/updated facets, executes `diamondCut`, and logs the output.
  6. `markov reset`: Reverts to a previous contract state by executing a reverting `diamondCut`.
  7. `markov status`: Performs a health check on the deployed smart contract (e.g., via loupe facets).
  8. `markov sync`: Syncs local history with on-chain `DiamondCut` events to prevent desync.
  9. `markov branch <create|switch|list>`: Manages branches for parallel development of facets.
  10. `markov merge <branch>`: Merges cuts from another branch, with conflict resolution for selector clashes.
  11. `markov optimize`: Uses AI to analyze and suggest/apply gas optimizations for facets before deployment.
  12. `markov analyze`: Runs AI-driven vulnerability scans and audits on facets pre-deploy.
  13. `markov propose`: Submits a `diamondCut` proposal to an on-chain governance contract (e.g., DAO).
  14. `markov viz`: Generates visualizations of facet structures and history (e.g., ASCII graphs).
  15. `markov migrate`: Automates state migration scripts during upgrades/resets.
  16. `markov stats`: Provides analytics on gas usage, upgrade frequency, etc., from history and on-chain data.
  17. `markov agent <start|stop|report>`: Manages an autonomous AI agent that uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to track and report on-chain activities (e.g., real-time monitoring of contract events/transactions via blockchain APIs, generating periodic reports or alerts). Leverage Blockscout MCP for data querying, Fetch.ai uAgents for agent autonomy, and Agentverse for ecosystem integration.

- **Notes**:
  - Base the folder structure on the Hardhat 3 plugin template: `packages/plugin` for plugin code, `packages/example-project` for testing.
  - Persist version history in `.markov/history.json` using a linear array for commits per branch (oldest at index 0) and a `Map<string, number>` for hash-to-index lookups; extend to a simple DAG for branching/merging.
  - Use viem via `hre.viem` for contract interactions (e.g., `hre.viem.deployContract`, `hre.viem.getWalletClient`, `hre.viem.simulateContract` for safety checks).
  - Assume the Hardhat project has Solidity files for Diamond components (e.g., `Diamond.sol`, `DiamondCutFacet.sol`, `DiamondLoupeFacet.sol`, and custom facets).
  - Handle gas prices, signers, and network configurations from the plugin's extended config; support multi-chain via `hre.network.name`.
  - For AI integrations, add dependencies like `@langchain/openai` or similar for gas optimization (e.g., using models like GasAgent) and analysis (e.g., integrating Slither-like tools with AI prompts).
  - For MCP: Integrate the TypeScript MCP SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk`) to connect to Blockscout MCP server (e.g., https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp) or Agentverse MCP (e.g., https://mcp.agentverse.ai/sse); use tools like `get_address_info`, `transaction_summary` for tracking Diamond activities. Incorporate Fetch.ai uAgents for autonomous behavior and Agentverse for registration/discovery. The agent runs as a background process, querying MCP tools periodically and generating reports.
  - Implement safety: Use `simulateContract` for dry-runs before cuts; add confirmations for risky ops.
  - Hybrid history: Query on-chain events with `hre.viem.getLogs` for verification/sync; enhance with MCP for advanced analytics.
  - Assumptions: User has API keys for AI services, MCP endpoints, and Fetch.ai/Agentverse; facets use standard selector computation via viem's `abi`; MCP is used for AI-to-blockchain connections, assuming SDK for TS integration.

## Data Structure for Version Control
- Support multi-branch with a simple DAG for history.
- **Structure**:
  - Map of branches to arrays of `Commit` objects: For sequential storage per branch and O(1) index access.
  - Hash map (`Map<string, {branch: string, index: number}>`) for O(1) lookups by commit hash across branches.
  - Parent pointers in commits for DAG traversal during merges.
- **Commit Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Commit {
    hash: string;  // SHA-256 of content
    timestamp: number;
    author: string;
    message: string;
    diamondAddress: string;
    cut: FacetCut[];  // { facetAddress: string, action: number, functionSelectors: string[] }
    parentHash?: string;  // For linear; multiple for merges
    branch: string;
  }
  ```
- **FacetCut Enum**: `0 = Add, 1 = Replace, 2 = Remove`.
- Persist to JSON; load on task start, save after changes; sync with on-chain for integrity.
- Operations: Append (O(1)), get by hash (O(1)), log (O(n) traversal per branch), reset (slice array), merge (combine cuts with conflict checks).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Requirements
1. **Setup Repository (This step has already been completed by the user, as the current file structure matches )**:
   - Start from Hardhat 3 plugin template.
   - Rename to `@yourname/hardhat-markov`.
   - Install dependencies: `hardhat`, `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-viem`, `viem`, `fs-extra`, `crypto`, `@langchain/openai` (for AI), `inquirer` (for prompts), `@modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk` (for MCP), `@fetchai/uagents` (for uAgents integration).

2. **Extend Hardhat Config**:
   - Add `markov` config options: chain, wallet, gasPrice, author, aiApiKey (for AI features), governanceAddress (optional), mcpEndpoint (for MCP agent connections, default: 'https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp'), agentverseApiToken (for Agentverse).
   - Validate and resolve defaults.
   - Use type extensions for `HardhatUserConfig` and `HardhatConfig`.

3. **Implement VersionHistory Class**:
   - In `src/history.ts`: Load/save from JSON, append commits with hashing, get by hash, get log (per branch), reset to hash, sync with on-chain logs, handle branches/merges.

4. **Add Tasks**:
   - Use subtask structure: `hardhat markov <subcommand>`.
   - Implement each feature as specified, using viem via `hre.viem` for deployments and interactions.
   - For `init`: Deploy DiamondCutFacet, Diamond, LoupeFacet; execute initial cut; append to history.
   - For `clone`: Query source Diamond via loupe (using publicClient.getLogs), replicate deployments and cuts.
   - For `deploy`: Deploy new facets, compute selectors (viem's abi encoding), simulate then execute cut, append commit.
   - For `reset`: Fetch commit, compute reverting cut, simulate, execute, update history.
   - For new features: Implement branching (update branch map), merge (traverse DAG, resolve conflicts), optimize/analyze (use LangChain to prompt AI models for gas suggestions/vulns), propose (interact with governance ABI), viz (generate ASCII via deps), migrate (AST analysis via Hardhat compiler), stats (aggregate from logs).
   - For `agent`: Start/stop a background AI agent process that uses MCP SDK to connect to Blockscout/Agentverse servers; monitor contract events (using watchEvent or MCP tools like get_transaction_logs); integrate uAgents for autonomy; analyze activity with AI, and generate reports (e.g., to console or file); use MCP for secure, standardized AI-external system interactions.
   - Handle errors, log outputs; add --simulate flags.

5. **AI Integrations**:
   - In `src/ai.ts`: Classes for gas optimization (prompt AI to rewrite code for efficiency) and analysis (scan for common vulns like reentrancy); extend for MCP agent logic.

6. **MCP Agent Implementation**:
   - In `src/agent.ts`: Autonomous agent class that initializes MCP connections (using TypeScript SDK) to blockchain data sources like Blockscout; polls or watches on-chain activity (e.g., via viem's watchEvent for Diamond events or MCP tools); integrates Fetch.ai uAgents for decentralized execution; uses AI to process and report (e.g., summarize anomalies, usage stats).

7. **Testing**:
   - Add integration tests for all tasks, including new features (e.g., branching, AI mocks, agent simulation with mocked MCP).
   - Use example project for manual verification; include anvil forking for multi-chain tests.

8. **Publishing**:
   - Prepare for npm publish; add README with examples.

Output the complete code for key files (e.g., `src/index.ts`, `src/history.ts`, `src/ai.ts`, `src/agent.ts`, task files). Ensure it's production-ready, with proper error handling and TypeScript types. If any assumptions are made, note them.
